uptrendsimilarly when looking for a downtrendon a hiking ashy chart we want to lookout for one large red candle bodies andtwo no upper wicks on these candlesboth of these criteria occurringtogether indicate a strong downtrendStep 3 Add Indicatorsso now that you have understand thebasics of using hiking ashy charts let'shead over to the main strategythe next step is adding indicators tothe chartso click the indicator button in tradingview and search for ema then click themoving average exponential indicatortwice one two and then go to thesettingsfor the first ema and change the lengthto 50 and then change the color toyellow you can pick any color and iprefer to make the line a bit thickernow go to the settings for the secondema and change the value to 200 and iprefer to use a blue color for this oneand a bit thicker line just like thisand now we also need to add macdsearch 
for macd and add to the chart[Music]go to the setting in this strategy wewill not need the signal lines so untickthe macd and the signal lines we onlyhave the histogram and we'll also needto change the time frame for the macdso notice that we are in the five minutetime frame in the chart but for the macdwe're using the one minute time frameso we will use the 50 and the 200 ema asa trend indicator and we will alwaystake trades in the same direction as atrendso when the 50 ema is crossing the 200ema to the upside that is when theyellow line is above the blue line thenwe are allowed to make long positionsand then we will enter the trades onpullbacksso when we have a big downtick on themacd then we wait for a large green bodyon the hiking ashy candle and enter thetrade right awayso we're looking for a 
downtick on themacd that is bigger than the average nowwe'll say it's this one right there sowe wait for a large green hiking ashycandle and we enter our tradeStep 4 Enter Tradesso we take the profit that's 0.5 percentand we have a stop loss of 0.4 percentand as you can see these traders alsowinand then we're looking for anotherdowntick that is bigger than averagenow i will say is this one right here soi will enter at this large green bodycandleso we entered a trade right here andtake a profit of 0.5 percent and have astop loss of 0.4 percentand we won't enter trades as close tothe crossover as possible theprobability of a win is a lot highercloser to the crossoverso after you made about three to fivetrades after the crossover stop tradingand wait for the next crossover and thesame thing applies to shorting as wellwhen the 50 mar is crossing 
the 200 dmato the downside then we can only takeshort positionsso now we're waiting for an uptick onthe macd that is bigger than averageand then we can enter a short positionso i would say this uptick is biggerthan averageso we will enter short right here atthis large red body and take profit of0.5 percent put the stop loss at 0.4percentthis is also win and then we're waitingfor another uptick that's bigger thanaverageand i would enter right here and takethe profit at 0.5 percent and set thestop loss at 0.4 percentand this is also a win then we haveanother big uptick herei would enter right there and set thetarget at 0.5 percentand the stop goes up 0.4 percent[Music]and this is also a winStep 5 Stop Tradingand then after a few trades stop tradingbecause it's getting riskier and riskiersince we are in the five minute timeframe crossovers like this happens a fewtimes 
per day and we only need to makefive trades per dayso there's no stress after the crossoverwe can stop trading after a few tradesthe next step is knowing the potentialand using the right leverageas you can see in this profit calculatorif we start with 100 us dollars and wehave a win rate at around 70 percent andtaking profit of 0.5 percent and havinga stop loss of 0.4 percentand we make 120 trades in a month that'sin average four trades per day and usinga 50x leverage we can actually make overtwenty three thousand dollars per monthwith this strategyand this only works with exactly 50xleveragethe next step is to trade on the rightexchangeto trade a scalping strategy like thisyou really need to use an exchange thatis good for scalping there are hundredsof exchanges out there and only a few ofthem are really good for scalpingso what you need to look for is 
anexchange with super low fees because weare taking profit at 0.5 percent and weuse a stop loss at 0.4 percentso if your trading fees are high it willeat too much of the profit and thisstrategy will no longer workfor example if we use binance here as anexchange look at these fees 0.1 percentfor limit orders and 0.1 percent formarket orders0.2 percent from the profit will betaken in feesso that is obviously too much so if werun this strategy with finance we wouldlose all the money after just a fewtradesbecause this is a very high scalpingtype of trading the only exchange for meto take all of these trades are be a biton bit i will make money when i'm usingmarket orders i only pay0.075 in feesand this is the lowest i've found outthereso this is really really good forscalpingand i'm using market orders for myentries and limit orders for my exitso 
i will pay an average 0.05 percent infees on each tradeand that's enough to turn 100 into 23000 based on the strategy after 120tradesthat is it for today's video thanks forwatching and before you go don't forgetto give this video a like and alsosubscribe and turn on notifications forfuture videosyou
